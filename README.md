~~shattered~~cracked-pixel-dungeon-gdx
=================
Modded for a more relaxed gameplay.
Modifications:
- +1 STR on level up
- Doesn't delete character when dead (leaves the last save game). If you made a mistake, DIE ;) (oh but don't use ladders nor jump into chasm and obviously, don't quit)

How you use this is up to you ;)

GDX port of [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon) the awesome fork of [Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon)

Quickstart
----------

Do `./gradlew <task>` to compile and run the project, where `task` is:

* Desktop: `desktop:run`
* Android: `android:installDebug android:run`
* iOS: `launchIosDevice` or `launchIphoneSimulator` or `launchIpadSimulator`
* HTML: `html:superDev` (this doesn't work yet, some classes need to be changed)
* Generate IDEA project: `idea`
